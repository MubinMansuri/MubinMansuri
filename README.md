## 💡 Who I Am

I’m a passionate WordPress developer and front-end engineer with 7+ years of professional experience crafting scalable, fast-loading, SEO-optimized websites for startups, agencies, and businesses around the world.

I specialize in custom themes, Gutenberg blocks, plugin development, and WooCommerce solutions—with a strong focus on performance tuning, accessibility (WCAG 2.1), and maintainable codebases.

But that’s not all—I’ve fully embraced **AI tools** like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Notion AI into my daily workflow, reducing repetitive effort and delivering **faster, cleaner, and smarter** solutions without compromising quality.

Whether you’re a product owner, agency lead, or technical recruiter—I build products that not only **look good and load fast** but also **scale well and convert better**.
